# File Manager Project

This project implements a simple file management system using Python, demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts and the use of external libraries.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-manager-project.git
   cd file-manager-project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the main script:

```
python main.py
```

This will demonstrate the functionality of the FileManager class, including reading from a file, writing to a file, searching for keywords, and analyzing the file using pandas.

## Project Structure

- `file_manager.py`: Contains the FileManager class implementation
- `main.py`: Demonstrates the usage of the FileManager class
- `log.txt`: Sample log file for testing
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies

## The `requirements.txt` File

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the Python packages that the project depends on. In this project, we use pandas for data analysis. By specifying the exact versions of the dependencies, we ensure that the project works consistently across different environments.

To install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, use:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the specified packages and their correct versions, ensuring that your environment matches the one used for development.
